-------

The Android translation files consist of a `values` directory and a `strings.xml` file. The original 
English translation file can be found in the `values-en-original` directory.

Follow the next steps to add a new language:
1. make a directory with the following name `values-XX`, where `XX` is the two letter language code 
according to the [ISO 639-1 standard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1). One can use [this list 
of language codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes).
2. copy the `strings.xml` file from the 'values-en-original` directory or another directory with a 
language that you master and translate the file. 

Thanks!
